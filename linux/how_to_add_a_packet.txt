1) copy a simple packet (like the speed message), and rename the things substituting speed wih your things
2) add in the .h all the fields you need

3) write the serialization functions (just replace the name of the fields with the ones you need to be serialized)
   (write, read and print)

5) write a single line description string for the command"

4) write the initialization functions. The global variable of the message type should be only in the .h
   (initHandler, and initHeader) [just copy and replace]

5) go in the file packets.h and add your initHandler there.

Everything is easy.

If you want to continue sending commands as you did before, it is sufficient that
- you enclose them in quotes "like this"
- you implement and install a handler for the strings
- standard strings and packed commands can coexist in a stream.
